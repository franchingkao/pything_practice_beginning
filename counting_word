Ornithoptera alexandrae is the largest butterfly in the world.

The female lays about 27 eggs during its entire lifespan. The caterpillars eat the pipe-vine plant, which contains poison, making the butterfly toxic to predators. Males are strongly territorial and will chase potential rivals, and sometimes small birds as well. It is named in honour of Queen Alexandra, wife of King Edward VII of the United Kingdom.
